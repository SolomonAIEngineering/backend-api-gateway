While the specific calculations might vary based on the goals and requirements of the individual or organization, here are five potential ways to converge on a single financial health score based on the schema you've provided:  Income-to-Expense Ratio: One of the basic ways to determine financial health is by comparing the income to expense ratio. In this case, income could be determined by the transactions where the 'Amount' is positive and 'Sign' is 1, and expense could be transactions where the 'Amount' is negative and 'Sign' is -1. The ratio could be calculated for a certain period, like monthly or yearly. A higher income-to-expense ratio indicates better financial health.  Transaction Diversity: Another indication of financial health is transaction diversity. Using the 'Categories' field, we can determine if a user's expenses are diversified across different categories or focused heavily on one. A balanced distribution across categories like rent, groceries, utilities, healthcare, savings, etc. could be a positive sign, indicating that the user is managing their finances well.  Debt-to-Income Ratio: If we have data about a user's debts (like loans or credit card bills), we can calculate the debt-to-income ratio. Income data can be extracted from the 'Amount' field where 'Sign' is 1, and debt could be transactions associated with debt repayment (if we have such category). A lower debt-to-income ratio signifies better financial health.  Frequency of Overdrafts: Using the 'Amount' field, you can monitor how often an account goes into negative balance (overdraft). Frequent overdrafts may indicate that a user is living paycheck-to-paycheck, which could signify poor financial health.  Investment vs. Expense Ratio: If we have information about investments, such as retirement contributions or stock purchases (provided in 'Categories' or another field), we could calculate the ratio of investment to expenses. A higher ratio indicates the user is saving for the future, which is a positive sign of financial health.  Please note that these metrics may not be comprehensive, as financial health is a broad concept. The provided schema does not include all possible data that might be relevant, such as savings account balance, credit score, net worth, etc. These additional data points, if available, could significantly improve the accuracy of a financial health score."},{"id":"content:3.engineering:2.plaid-webhooks-definitions.md","path":"/engineering/plaid-webhooks-definitions","dir":"engineering","title":"Plaid Webhooks Definitions","description":"","keywords":["Webhooks"],"body":"  Webhooks  Item Based Webhooks  We need to ensure we provision the following sets of webhooks   item-based webhooks   ERROR\nFired when an error is encountered with an Item.

This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook when using the /transactions/sync endpoint. Note that when using /transactions/sync the older webhooks INITIAL_UPDATE, HISTORICAL_UPDATE, DEFAULT_UPDATE, and TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED, which are intended for use with /transactions/get, will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using /transactions/sync.  After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from /transactions/sync.  Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, /transactions/sync must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the INITIAL_UPDATE and HISTORICAL_UPDATE webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If /transactions/sync is called on an Item that was not initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.  This webhook will typically not fire in the Sandbox environment, due to the lack of dynamic transactions data. To test this webhook in Sandbox, call /sandbox/item/fire_webhook.      {\n       \"webhook_type\"  :   \"TRANSACTIONS\"  ,\n       \"webhook_code\"  :   \"SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE\"  ,\n       \"item_id\"  :   \"wz666MBjYWTp2PDzzggYhM6oWWmBb\"  ,\n       \"initial_update_complete\"  :   true  ,\n       \"historical_update_complete\"  :   false  ,\n       \"environment\"  :   \"production\"\n   }  RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE  Fired when recurring transactions data is updated. This includes when a new recurring stream is detected or when a new transaction is added to an existing recurring stream. The RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE webhook will also fire when one or more attributes of the recurring stream changes, which is usually a result of the addition, update, or removal of transactions to the stream.\nAfter receipt of this webhook, the updated data can be fetched from /transactions/recurring/get.      {\n       \"webhook_type\"  :   \"TRANSACTIONS\"  ,\n       \"webhook_code\"  :   \"RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE\"  ,\n       \"item_id\"  :   \"wz666MBjYWTp2PDzzggYhM6oWWmBb\"  ,\n       \"account_ids\"  : [\n         \"lPNjeW1nR6CDn5okmGQ6hEpMo4lLNoSrzqDje\"  ,\n         \"lPNjeW1nR6CDn5okmGQ6hEpMo4lLNoSrzqDff\"\n     ],\n       \"environment\"  :   \"production\"\n   }  INITIAL_UPDATE  Fired when an Item's initial transaction pull is completed. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data for the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. If Account Select v2 is enabled, this webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with new_transactions set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.  This webhook is intended for use with /transactions/get; if you are using the newer /transactions/sync endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook instead.      {\n       \"webhook_type\"  :   \"TRANSACTIONS\"  ,\n       \"webhook_code\"  :   \"INITIAL_UPDATE\"  ,\n       \"item_id\"  :   \"wz666MBjYWTp2PDzzggYhM6oWWmBb\"  ,\n       \"error\"  :   null  ,\n       \"new_transactions\"  :   19  ,\n       \"environment\"  :   \"production\"\n   }  HISTORICAL_UPDATE  Fired when an Item's historical transaction pull is completed and Plaid has prepared as much historical transaction data as possible for the Item. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data beyond the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. If Account Select v2 is enabled, this webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with new_transactions set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.  This webhook is intended for use with /transactions/get; if you are using the newer /transactions/sync endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook instead.      {\n       \"webhook_type\"  :   \"TRANSACTIONS\"  ,\n       \"webhook_code\"  :   \"HISTORICAL_UPDATE\"  ,\n       \"item_id\"  :   \"wz666MBjYWTp2PDzzggYhM6oWWmBb\"  ,\n       \"error\"  :   null  ,\n       \"new_transactions\"  :   231  ,\n       \"environment\"  :   \"production\"\n   }  TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED  Fired when transaction(s) for an Item are deleted. The deleted transaction IDs are included in the webhook payload. Plaid will typically check for deleted transaction data several times a day.  This webhook is intended for use with /transactions/get; if you are using the newer /transactions/sync endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook instead.      {\n       \"webhook_type\"  :   \"TRANSACTIONS\"  ,\n       \"webhook_code\"  :   \"TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED\"  ,\n       \"item_id\"  :   \"wz666MBjYWTp2PDzzggYhM6oWWmBb\"  ,\n       \"removed_transactions\"  : [\n         \"yBVBEwrPyJs8GvR77N7QTxnGg6wG74H7dEDN6\"  ,\n         \"kgygNvAVPzSX9KkddNdWHaVGRVex1MHm3k9no\"\n     ],\n       \"error\"  :   null  ,\n       \"environment\"  :   \"production\"\n   }  .dark .ct-948368{color:#E1E4E8;}\n.ct-948368{color:#24292E;}\n.dark .ct-484930{color:#79B8FF;}\n.ct-484930{color:#005CC5;}\n.dark .ct-497092{color:#9ECBFF;}\n.ct-497092{color:#032F62;}"},{"id":"content:3.engineering:3.testing-webhooks.md","path":"/engineering/testing-webhooks","dir":"engineering","title":"Testing Webhooks","description":"","keywords":["Plaid Webhooks","Stripe Payments"],"body":"  Plaid Webhooks  To properly test plaid webhooks, you must ensure that the service and all dependencies are running locally.\nAdditionally, you must ensure that you can access our ngrok account   here \nwith the following credentials      email:     yoan@simfinii.com\n   password:     Granada123!

Forward Webhooks to Local Server:   In the terminal, use the command:   stripe listen --forward-to <local_server_url>/webhook-endpoint  Replace   <local_server_url>  with the URL of your locally running web service where the webhook endpoint is configured to receive Stripe events.            # in the case of the service, run the following command    \n         stripe     listen     --forward-to     localhost:9898/webhook         Create Test Events:   In another terminal window, use the Stripe CLI to trigger test events. For example, you can simulate a payment intent succeeded event by running:   stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded .  Refer to the Stripe CLI documentation for a list of available test event types and their corresponding triggers.   Verify Webhook Handling:   Check your locally running web service logs or console output to ensure that it receives the forwarded webhook events.  Validate that your webhook endpoint correctly processes the events, such as updating your application's data or triggering any necessary actions.  By following these instructions, you can extensively test your Stripe webhook implementations by simulating various events and ensuring your local server handles them correctly. This approach allows you to verify the integration between your web service and the Stripe API without relying on the production environment or making live charges.  .dark .ct-970614{color:#B392F0;}\n.ct-970614{color:#6F42C1;}\n.dark .ct-948368{color:#E1E4E8;}\n.ct-948368{color:#24292E;}\n.dark .ct-497092{color:#9ECBFF;}\n.ct-497092{color:#032F62;}\n.ct-086898{color:#6A737D;}\n.dark .ct-484930{color:#79B8FF;}\n.ct-484930{color:#005CC5;}"},{"id":"content:3.engineering:4.setup.md","path":"/engineering/setup","dir":"engineering","title":"Setup","description":"","keywords":["Running The Service Locally","Install Pre-Commmit Hooks"],"body":"  Running The Service Locally   This document aims to serve as a guide to get this service and its dependencies up and running.

This service (leveraging the Plaid API) will serve as a single source of truth for all financial records on Simfinii.  Motivation  Simfinii provides a medium by which numerous stakeholders can not only track the health of their finances, but leverage their peers and our various offerings to achieve all conceivable financial goals they may withhold. Given the nature of the platform we are building, properly architecting the flow of financial data across the Simfinii ecosystem is a component critical to providing the value we believe our users need. The financial integration service plays an instrumental role in this realm from the context of the backend.  Through the financial integration service, users are able to obtain a holistic view of their financial health spanning investments, liabilities, and past transactions. This will serve as the core service driving all features requiring user financial data.  This technical design document provides granular details specific to service level interactions, dependencies, monitoring, …etc. The aim here is to provide as much detail as possible in hopes of easing the onboarding process of any future developer and effectively providing a reference to be utilized throughout development.  Potential/Proposed Solutions  The financial integration functionality is made up of the following set of dependencies:   Singular service   Features encompass transaction management (credit, debit, & investment accounts), and account balance + liability inquiries.  Could potentially support expense reporting, cash flow modeling, risk analysis,  PostgreSQL Database  This service exposes a set of gRPC endpoints through which API consumers can interact with the data it presides over. gRPC was picked as the communication protocol of choice for many reasons defined below.   gRPC uses HTTP/2 which allows support for highly performant and scalable APIs making use of binary data  More compact and efficient communication scheme through binary payload  Easier to generate client side gRPC libraries  Low latencies, especially beneficial to us as we ensure the service meets strict SLA requirements.  PostgreSQL is the database of choice for this service. We decided to use this database due in part to its extensibility. Postgres allows us to define our own types, build custom function aligned with our business needs, and abide by many of the features required by the SQL standard. Below are further reasons we chose to select this database as our main storage component.   Common & Custom Data Types (Primitive, Structured, Document, Geometry, & Customizable types)  Data Integrity through exclusion constraints and explicit + advisory locks  Concurrency & Performance   Sophisticated query planner and optimizer, multi version concurrency control, read query parallelization, table partitioning, JIT compilation of expressions, sophisticated and isolated transactions  Reliability & Disaster Recovery   Asynchronous and Synchronous replication, Write ahead logging, tablespaces,...etc  Robust access control system, Column + Row Level security  Extensibility   Stored functions & procedures, customizable storage interfaces, foreign data wrappers  In summary, we believe that PostgreSQL as our storage unit and grpc as our api allow us to have the most performant service inherently elevating the quality of our end customers experience.  Assumptions/Estimations  No assumptions are currently present outside of those defined in the below set of estimations. However, this section is prone to change especially as the service level requirements change.  Capacity Estimation   NOTE: Complete Later  Storage Estimation   NOTE: Complete Later  Bandwidth Estimation   NOTE: Complete Later  Memory Estimation   NOTE: Complete Later  Constraints/Limitations  According to the CAP theorem it is not possible for a distributed system to provide more than two of the following guarantees simultaneously.   Consistency: Consistency implies that every read receives the most recent write or errors out  Availability: Availability implies that every request receives a response. It is not guaranteed that the response contains the most recent write or data.  Partition tolerance: Partition tolerance refers to the tolerance of a storage system to failure of a network partition. Even if some of the messages are dropped or delayed the system continues to operate.  CAP theorem implies that when using a network partition, with the inherent risk of partition failure, one has to choose between consistency and availability and both cannot be guaranteed at the same time.  High availability is a priority for social financial applications and to this objective, the financial integration service chooses availability and partition tolerance from the CAP guarantees compromising on data consistency to some extent. We are comfortable with eventual consistency and these ideals are defined in our architecture and service level interactions.  To enforce this notion of eventual consistency, all write requests should be performed with the proper set of retries upon encountered failures. Additionally, a granular set of metrics should be emitted for all operations on the write path. Sensitive alerting should be present on all critical API paths or paths involved in any distributed transaction comprised of numerous stage changes across more than 1 service. **** All reads/writes on the contrary are performed via the gRPC api invocation. Lastly, this service's load patterns will primarily be on the READs side hence, any mechanism introduced to elevate scale should take this into account.  System Design/Architecture  System Diagram & Flowchart    Terminology & Components  SLA: Service Level Agreements  CAP: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance  PostgreSQL: Database which stores records in tabular form  gRPC: Open source remote procedure call system which uses HTTP/2 for transport and protocol buffers as the interface description language  Hard & Soft Requirements  This is a very crucial part of the system. Hence, if there is an outage across all instances, users will no longer have access to financial records. Not to mention the various consuming services that leverage the financial data provided by this service to provide value to our end users.. Additionally, API consumers will experience enormous latencies as queues fill up while trying to service write operations. This potentially exposes us to dropped messages and a backend composed of many divergent states. An outage with this service would substantially affect our business offerings. Thus, it is crucial we provision the proper mitigations in place to limit this from occurring.  Some potential mitigations to set in place are the following:   Ensure at least 5 stateless instances of the service are always running behind a load balancer allowing for automatic failover to other instances  Ensure LinkerD sidecar deployed alongside every service   Metrics, load balancing, retries, timeouts, traffic split  Provide extensive telemetry   Custom Metrics (Infra., Operational, Business Logic, Requests, Failure Rates, Database Performance Metrics, ...etc)  Sensitive Alerting Logic  Service level dependency isolation  Set Request Timeouts & Leverage Circuit Breaker  Allow service to report health metrics and diagnostics.  Leverage a redis cluster and cache responses of frequently invoked APIs (compress payloads)  Reference the following   resource  for further elaborations on resiliency techniques in distributed systems.  Algorithm & Pseudocode For Main Components  Update Operations  Any operation which updates/deletes the state of a financial record must eventually occur regardless of whether the service is available or not. With this constraint, all update operations are read from a message queue by the financial integration service. This is done via a go-routine which subscribes to a channel and processes said events. Operations depending on the use case are performed against our Cassandra instance as well as the Plaid API if required.  Events must withhold granular details as well as metadata associated with the operation.   The event schema definition will be further elaborated upon in the future.  Query Operations  Query operations will be performed through the gRPC Api endpoint.  SLA & Service Guarantees  These are defined in the constraints and limitation sections. Further elaboration will reside in this section.  Data Definition, Schema Design, Persistence Requirements  Miscellaneous   Securities (Schema)  The securities scheme provides a view of all the security holdings a given account has.   Note:  It is not meant to provide the current monetary value of an account as that would force us to somehow track security prices which adds another level of complexity to our backend      Security\n   Fields:\n       ID\n       F.K.

Each balance object withholds a primary key to the account (not virtual account ... plaid account in this case) which is its owner (record created in our own backend).      Balance\n   Fields:\n       ID \n       F.K.

A virtual account abstracts a grouping of separate plaid accounts a user can have. All child account types withhold a mapping to a parent virtual account and in the relational world this is enforced through primary keys.  Example: A user may have numerous plaid accounts comprised of loans, credit, savings, debt acct.... etc. A virtual account encompasses all such accts and associates such to user records. Meaning for each user record created there is one virtual account which can have N actual accounts (all obtained from PLAID API)      Virtual Account\n   Fields:\n       ID (this is another name for integrationAccountID)\n       AccessToken\n       UserID (Simfinii internal Unique User Id)   Deposit Account (Schema)      Deposit Account\n   Fields:\n       ID\n       **F.K.

We invoke the /item/public_token/exchange PLAID API to exchange the public token for the permanent   access_token . Access token is then stored as part of the user's table   RESPONSE - From Financial Integration Service      {\n         \"integration_account_id\"  :   kjhauhdfo  2108  y  283\n   }  Caching Requirements  As of now we will cache requests spanning account balances as well as investment withholdings adhering to some filtering clause/condition.  As far as cache size, it is difficult to properly estimate the necessary size prematurely. However, we know that we will store the compressed binary payload cached entries in hopes of limiting the space used.  In terms of eviction time, we will cache entries for 10 minutes prior to refresh.  We will heavily utilize a cache with this service to reduce the number of fetch operations to disk on our Cassandra instance. This will greatly reduce CPU usage and network consumption and provide  us with fast response times, and potentially increase service uptime.  Capacity Planning  The service is expected to generate a decent amount of logs, metrics, and traces. NewRelic will be the service through which we aggregate all data generated by the service. The proposed retention policy is 1 month.  Performance Requirements  Financial Integration Service   Expected throughput: 50K QPS  Expected Latencies: < 9ms  Please reference   grpc performance best practices  throughout development to optimize performance.  Security  The service does not handle any PII/PCI data as of yet.  Multi Region Story  The service does not have any multi-region requirements as of yet. This service will be deployed in a cloud environment hence, we hope to not have to account multi-region availability or zone outages throughout development.  API/gRPC Endpoints  Please reference the   grpc endpoint documentation  throughout development.  Rollout Plan  Rollout Phases  Rollout phases will be determined later.  A/B Tests  A/B Tests will be determined later.  Data Migration  Data Migration plans will be determined later.  Test Plan  Testing is crucial and will be prioritized throughout development. Unit tests will be of high importance. We mandate that each service has at least 85% unit test coverage. As for testing dependencies through integration and load tests, we will perform this in four phases.   Phase 1: Mock dependency response & test logic (unit tests)  Phase 2: Spin up dependencies in docker containers   Run local integration test suite against grpc endpoints & ensure expected response is obtained  Phase 3: Spin up service dependencies in local & sandboxed kubernetes cluster   Run   Helm Test  ensuring proper expected response is obtained for each integration test  Phase 4: Through use of   vegeta load testing tool  we will perform load tests against services running in kubernetes sandbox environment  Phase 5: The final stage of testing will apply chaos testing. We will enable certain environment variables which will fail some requests based on some preset probability. With this, we will perform load tests once again and ensure the proper set of metrics are emitted and the service is behaving as expected.   NOTE : it is important all these can be performed both locally and within our CI/CD workflow.  Appendix   References, links to additional documentation (E.g.

For example, if a user has one login at their bank that allows them to access\nboth their checking account and their savings account, a single Item would be associated with both of those accounts. Each Item\nlinked within your application will have a corresponding access_token, which is a token that you can use to make API requests related\nto that specific Item.\nTwo Items created for the same set of credentials at the same institution will be considered different and not share the same item_id.

You will typically obtain an access_token by calling /item/public_token/exchange. For more details, see the Token exchange flow. An access_token does not expire, although it may require updating, such as when a user changes their password, or when working with European institutions that comply with PSD2's 90-day consent window. For more information, see When to use update mode. Access tokens should always be stored securely, and associated with the user whose data they represent. If compromised, an access_token can be rotated via /item/access_token/invalidate. If no longer needed, it can be revoked via /item/remove.(gorm.field).has_one = {disable_association_autocreate: false disable_association_autoupdate: false preload: true}];   bank_accounts   BankAccount  repeated  a link event - or client login event can have many connected bank accounts for example a log in link against one instition like chase can have many account (checking and savings) it is important though to ensure that if a link against an instition already exists, we dont fascilitate duplicated   investment_accounts   InvestmentAccount  repeated  a link event - or client login event can have many connected investment accounts for example a log in link against one instition like fidelity can have many accounts (401k and investment account) it is important though to ensure that if a link against an instition already exists, we dont fascilitate duplicated   credit_accounts   CreditAccount  repeated  credit accounts tied to a user   mortgage_accounts   MortgageAccount  repeated  mortgage accounts tied to a user   student_loan_accounts   StudentLoanAccount  repeated  student loan accounts tied to a link   plaid_institution_id   string   the id of the institution this link is tied to and against   link_type   LinkType   the type of link this is ... can be either a manual or plaid link type   error_code   string     updated_at   string     new_accounts_available   bool     should_be_updated   bool      LinkedAccountingAccount     Field  Type  Label  Description    id   uint64   id   attachments   Attachments  repeated  Represent a company's attachments. a business can have many attachments   company_info   CompanyInfo  repeated  The CompanyInfo object is used to represent a company's information.   purchase_orders   PurchaseOrder  repeated  a business can have many purchase orders   report_details   ReportDetails   a business can have one report object   reference_details   ReferenceDetails     transactions_details   TransactionDetails      MergeLink  ===============================     Field  Type  Label  Description    id   uint64   id   integration   string     integration_slug   string     category   string     end_user_origin_id   string     end_user_organization_name   string     end_user_email_address   string     status   string     webhook_listener_url   string     is_duplicate   bool     token   Token     integration_name   string     integration_image   string     integration_square_image   string     account   LinkedAccountingAccount  repeated  When you request a link token to initiate a Merge Link session, Merge determines whether to create a new linked account or modify an existing linked account based on a combination of the end_user_origin_id and the category. If you want to support multiple connections, you simply need to provide a different end_user_origin_id for each company.  This approach enables you to link multiple instances of the same integration (like QuickBooks) for the same end user. It also has the added security benefit of not exposing any internal end_user_origin_ids. |\n| merge_linked_account_id |   string  |  |  |    Milestone  Milestone: represents a milestone in the context of simfinni.

The financial\nintegration service plays an instrumental role in this realm from the context of the backend.  Through the financial integration service, users are able to obtain a holistic view of their financial health\nspanning investments, liabilities, and past transactions. This will serve as the core service driving all\nfeatures requiring user financial data.  Introduction  This chart bootstraps the headless authentication service deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.  This chart can be used with Kubeapps for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of a Kubernetes Runtime.  Requirements  Kubernetes:   >=1.19.0-0   Kubernetes 1.19+  Helm 3.2.0+  PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure  Installing the Chart  To install the chart with the release name   my-release :      $     helm     repo     add     simfinii     https://github.com/SimifiniiCTO/simfinii\n   $     helm     install     my-release     simfinii/financial-integration-service  These commands deploy the financial integration service on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The Parameters section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.    Tip : List all releases using   helm list  Uninstalling the Chart  To uninstall/delete the   my-release  deployment:      $     helm     delete     my-release  The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

each parameter using the   --set key=value[,key=value]  argument to   helm install . For example,      $     helm     install     my-release     \\\n       --set     image.repository=feelguuds/financial-integration-service     \\\n         simfinii/financial-integration-service  The above command sets the repository from which to get the container of interest.   NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.  Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,      $     helm     install     my-release     -f     values.yaml     simfinii/financial-integration-service    Tip : You can use the default   values.yaml  Troubleshooting  Find more information about how to deal with common errors related to Melodiy's Helm charts in   this troubleshooting guide .
